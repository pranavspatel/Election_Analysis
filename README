## Election Audit Summary
This script can be altered to find the most number of votes for different filters other than candidates and county. If the data included other characteristics, such as demographics and location, the code can be modified to include these characteristics and further analysis can be done.
This script can also be altered to find patterns among the characteristics. We can test the % of voters by county against each candidate. This can allow us to see which candidate was the most popular within a county or geographical area.
